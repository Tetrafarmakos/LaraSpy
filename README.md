   mv .env.example .env
   ```

2. Generate a unique application key for Laravel:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

### 4. Configure Database Settings

1. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and update the database credentials with your MySQL information:

   ```plaintext
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username

   ```

2. Create a MySQL database that matches the name specified in the `DB_DATABASE` value in your `.env` file or in `config/database.php`.

### 5. Run Database Migrations

Run the migrations to create the necessary tables in the database:
